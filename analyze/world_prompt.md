# Analysis spec — how to produce the DECODED World brief

This is the **World News** pillar — separate from Markets. The reader is smart but **new to world
affairs and markets**, reads on a phone, and wants the *decoded* version of the day: not raw
headlines, but what each story actually means, why it matters, what it sets in motion, and why it's
in front of them today. Assume nothing is obvious. Explain the context a headline takes for granted.

Read `output/world-raw-latest.json` for the raw feed, then run **WebSearch** to confirm facts, get the
latest, and fill gaps. Write **strict JSON** matching the schema below to
`output/world-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` and copy it to `output/world-latest.json`.

## Selection discipline
- Pick the **8–12 stories that genuinely matter today** — the ones you "shouldn't miss."
  Rank #1 first by real-world importance (scale of impact × how many people/systems it touches ×
  how much it changes from yesterday).
- Cover the spread: don't return 8 politics stories. Range across geopolitics, economy, technology,
  science, health, climate/energy — whatever is actually important today.
- **INDIA IS HOME — never bury it.** The reader lives in India. Include **at least 3–4 substantial
  India stories** among the ranked stories (national news, economy/policy, markets, India's place in
  the world), decoded to the same depth as everything else — not as "also notable" filler. Use the
  India feeds in `world-raw-latest.json` plus WebSearch. If a global story has a specific India angle
  (oil prices, trade, rupee, diaspora), spell that angle out.
- A story earns its place only if you can explain why it matters. If you can't, drop it.

## Decoding discipline (the whole point — go DEEP)
For **every** story, fully decode it. Write in plain language, short sentences, no unexplained jargon
(if you must use a term like "sovereign debt", "current-account deficit", or "quantitative tightening",
define it inline AND add it to `key_terms`). Each field below must be genuinely and richly filled —
this is the depth the reader asked for. Don't be terse; expand and explain. The reader would rather
read three extra sentences that make them *understand* than a clipped summary they can't follow.

- **`background` is required** — give the backstory a newcomer needs: how we got here, the longer arc,
  who the players are. Someone who has never heard of this story should finish `background` +
  `what_happened` fully oriented.
- **Never invent facts or numbers.** Use the raw feed + cited web sources. If something is unconfirmed,
  say so. Cite at least one credible source per story (name + URL).
- Be neutral and factual on contested topics; present what's known and who claims what.

```

## Story threads (`thread`) — continuity across days
Before writing, read the 1–2 most recent `dashboard/archive/world-*.json` files. When today's story
**continues one we already covered**, add the `thread` object: `previously` must reflect what those
archived briefs *actually said* (never reconstruct from memory), and `changed` is what's genuinely new
since. This is how the reader follows a developing story instead of re-reading it from scratch.
**Never force a thread onto a genuinely new story — omit the field entirely.**

## The learning layer (`the_lesson` + `concepts`)
The reader wants to LEARN from the news, not just follow it. So every story carries:
- **`the_lesson`** (required): the transferable insight — the mechanism or principle this story
  illustrates. Not a summary of the story; a lesson the reader keeps after the news is stale.
- **`concepts`** (optional, max 4): keys into the dashboard glossary, rendered as tap-to-learn chips.
  **Use ONLY keys from this exact list — never invent keys; omit the field if none apply:**
  `inflation, interest_rates, central_bank, bond_market, tariffs, sanctions, gdp,
  fiscal_vs_monetary, supply_chain, fii_flows, crude_geopolitics, currency_strength,
  risk_on_off, vix, yields, bull_bear_market, usdinr, gold_asset, crude_asset, bitcoin_asset, index`

## Notes
- `the_big_picture` is the reader's favorite part — make it genuinely illuminating, the connective tissue.
- Explain, don't just report. The test: could a curious 16-year-old read a story and fully understand
  what happened AND why it matters? If not, add the missing context.
- `market_link` is the bridge to the Markets pillar — fill it whenever a world event moves assets.
- Keep each field tight and scannable, but complete. Depth over volume.
