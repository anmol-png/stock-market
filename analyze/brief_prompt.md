# Analysis spec — how to produce the daily brief

Read `output/raw-latest.json`, run WebSearch for the day's top global market headlines (and anything
missing, especially India news), then write the brief as **strict JSON** matching the schema below to
`output/brief-<YYYY-MM-DD>.json` and copy it to `output/brief-latest.json`.

## Depth discipline (the reader is new to markets — teach as you go)
- Do **not** write a thin overview. Explain the *why* behind every move, and define any term you use
  (e.g. "yields", "FII flows", "core inflation") in plain words inline. Numbers must be real (from the
  data or cited sources) — never invent them.
- `market_story` is the centerpiece: a short decoded narrative of *what is driving markets today and
  why*, connecting macro → sectors → the user's stocks, in language a beginner follows.
- `board` gives the key numbers with a one-line plain-English read each — not just a number.
- `themes` explains what's leading/lagging today and why.

## Ranking discipline
- `what_to_watch` = the 3–5 things that matter most **today**, across all markets, ranked #1 first.
- Favor items that change a price, a thesis, or a risk. Drop generic market color.
- **DECODE each one — do not leave it as a headline + a number.** The reader is new to markets, so each
  item must teach: what's happening (numbers explained in words), why it matters, what it means for them,
  and any jargon defined. Fill every field below.

## The learning layer (`the_lesson` + `concepts` on each what_to_watch item)
- **`the_lesson`** (required): the transferable market principle the item illustrates — something the
  reader keeps after today's numbers are stale.
- **`concepts`** (optional, max 4): glossary keys rendered as tap-to-learn chips. **Use ONLY keys from
  this list — never invent keys; omit if none apply:**
  `inflation, interest_rates, central_bank, bond_market, tariffs, sanctions, gdp, fiscal_vs_monetary,
  supply_chain, fii_flows, crude_geopolitics, currency_strength, risk_on_off, vix, yields,
  bull_bear_market, usdinr, gold_asset, crude_asset, bitcoin_asset, index, rsi, macd, moving_average,
  support_resistance, range_52w, volatility, overbought_oversold, pe, market_cap, beta`

## Notes
- Keep prose tight and scannable, but **substantive** — depth that's easy to digest, not a thin summary.
- `board` should span the key gauges: US (S&P/Nasdaq/Dow), India (Nifty/Sensex/Bank Nifty),
  crypto (BTC/ETH), commodities (Gold/Crude), and FX (USD/INR). Pull real values from
  `raw-latest.json` / `dashboard/stocks/index.json`; every entry needs a plain-English `read`.
- For each favorite, EXPLAIN the technical read in plain English (don't just cite RSI/DMA numbers).
- If `raw-latest.json` lacks India/crypto news, fill it from WebSearch and cite sources.
- Numbers must come from the data or cited sources — never invent them.
